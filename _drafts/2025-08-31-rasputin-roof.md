Approach
Approach as for Superbok/Cragganmore. Park in the pullout east of Field (xx.xxxxºN, -xxx.xxxxºE).

Cross the river, the tracks and climb up the open snow gully to Cragganmore on the left just before P1 of Superbok. Climb this for three pitches of rambly ice or thin mixed terrain to a bolted belay on the ledge below the huge roof (xx.xxxxºN, -xxx.xxxxºE). xx-xx hours.

Pitch By Pitch
Pitch 1: M4+ 25m
Left of the belay, climb a short crack then and head left on loose rock towards a discontinuous, right-facing, right-leaning corner system. Climb past two fixed pitons and a vein of ice, trending right. At the base of a steeper wall, go rightward past a bolt and move tenuously around a corner. Clip another bolt and go up flakes to a two bolt anchor below the deepest part of the roof.
Pitch 2: M9- WI5 25m
This pitch is entirely bolt/screw protected. Traverse left across a hanging slab on thin tools and better feet, and squeeze behind an ice curtain. Commit to a pumpy sequence across a horizontal roof before gaining the final ice curtain. Stem up and wrap around, heading straight up to a 3 bolt anchor or continuing out the final step of ice.

Descent
Rappel once to the base. Reverse the approach ice, rappelling as needed.

Gear
Cams #.2-3, mid sizes nuts, mid sized rack of screws. Double ropes, 70m useful.
