To climb strong in the winter, you need to:
- Keep hanging onto your tools
- Pull hard enough to get your next placement
- Move your body flexibly, especially in steep climbing

### Hang lots
The most common question I get from people is what I do for winter grip endurance. It's a great question!
I've tried many things but settled on a reasonably simple regimen that yields excellent results.

- Hang on your tools for 10-20 seconds at a time, with a matching amount of rest, for a total work time on each hand of at least a minute.
- Rest for 3-5 minutes
- Repeat for 3-5 sets, aiming to keep the total workout (without warmup or cooldown) approximately half an hour long
- Do this 2-3 times a week. Consistency is critical.

Let's break that down. The starting point is to hang with one hand on each tool. If this is the right amount of load for you, hang for 10-20 seconds, return to the ground for a matching 10-20 seconds, repeat.
You want to hang for at least a minute, so that could be six sets of 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off.
Or, for more difficulty, 3 sets of 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off.

If you need to make things easier, get something to support your weight, like feet on a chair or a pulley with a counterweight. If you need to make things more challenging, hang some weight off your harness.

For your progression, increase either the rep duration or number of sets until you're hanging for at least two minutes, then do something to increase the difficulty. If you don't have a good way to add weight, keep increasing rep count.

At some point, you'll feel strong enough to hang one-handed. I find one-armed dead hangs to be very rough on my shoulders, so my method here is what I call the '4-9 wiggle'. It's very similar to the two-handed approach, except every 10-20 seconds, you switch between hands in a figure 4 or 9, staying off the ground. It's harder to control the load in this situation, so I keep increasing the rep length until I'm at 20 seconds and then keep adding sets. The most I've hung on for in this fashion in my own training is 8 minutes. If you're getting toward that point, you're probably climbing at least M12 and might want a more sophisticated program for further progression.

To crush, or not to crush (your pinky). The first instinct people have when training on tools is to clip carabiners into the head of the tool. This puts your grip in a highly upright position and tends to make you stop hanging due to pinky pain before you stop hanging due to the pump. Training pinky-crushing is valid, but I get enough of that without suffering in the gym. Try hooking near the tip of your pick on carabiners instead, so the grip is more reclined. I've gone one step further and built a wooden training tool that allows for adjustable grip angles by shifting a clove hitch. If you want one, I'm happy to provide a template. Nick Baggaley is in the process of making some for sale as well.

## More to come
This is a rough draft, but I wanted to make something available. I'll be revisiting this in the coming weeks.
