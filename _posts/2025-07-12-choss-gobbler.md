---
Gavin and I climbed a new route on the NW face of Castle last weekend. It was a bit audacious of us to go for it in one push. Our 26-hour day went largely free and onsight, but we did resort to some aid-after-dark when the mood pivoted from “Let’s explore” to “Let’s get off this mountain in one piece”.

If anyone repeats it and wants to put a few protection bolts in (particularly on pitches 6, 7, and 9), feel free. I’m also open to feedback on the grades. Overhanging choss is hard to judge.

The route name alludes to our attempt to follow Marcus Baranow’s ski descent line back into Protection Valley. Our confession is that we do not know why we like to gobble choss.

**Confessions of a Choss Gobbler**  
**Castle Mountain**  
**5.11- A0 440m TD**  
**Gavin McNamara, Greg Barrett**  
**July 12-13, 2025**  

This is the first route on the stunning north-west headwall of Castle Mountain. The climbing is steep and sustained, and in many places very high quality. However, some of the rock is almost irredeemably chossy. If that isn’t what you’re after, look elsewhere. But if you’re a gobbler of choss, have a high risk tolerance, and you’re looking for a big day of adventure climbing, this may be your ticket.

**Approach**  
Park at a pullout near the Castle Mountain Campground. Approach as for the Protection Valley winter climbs, continuing past the scrambling step and bivvy boulder into Protection Valley proper. (This had good flagging tape as of 2025.) Head south, up to the base of the wall. Traverse west along the base until you come around to a large screen bowl below the steep north-west headwall. The route begins in a steep, chossy crack, 20 meters right of a prominent ramp/dihedral.  
Approximately <a href="https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=16.0/-115.9786/51.3370&pubLink=K4xAb6XQrgJCrBJBGLGsxhPN&waypointId=db6a9325-bae8-4d75-83eb-84f1c62e541e">51.33702, -115.97855</a>  
3 Hours.

**P1, 5.7, 55m**  
Climb the chossy crack (not quite as bad as it looks) to reach better rock. Continue upwards and belay on easier ground. Enjoyable after the first bit.

**P2, 5.0, 20m**  
Climb up and right on solid but run-out terrain, continuing up a rightward ramp until you are near an indistinct high point. There will be a shallow, left-facing corner system above and to your left. To your right, you will see a pair of steeper cracks leading into a generally right-facing corner system. Belay here.

**P3, 5.9, 55m**  
A steep, physical, quality pitch. Traverse right to gain the pair of steep cracks. Climb these. Continue upward, generally taking the leftward of the possible crack lines. You will reach a small cave behind a giant flake. Belay here.

**P4, 5.10-, 35m**  
Step up and right out of the cave to gain a steep tips crack. Enjoyable technical climbing leads to a ledge. Continue up a short wall and belay on a large ledge.

**P5, 5.7, 60m**  
Head up steeper walls from the belay to gain an extensive ledge system. Traverse right for 40m, targeting a pillar below a series of steep chossy cracks. Belay just before the pillar.

**P6, 5.11-, 30m**  
Move your belay behind the pillar. Starting from slightly left, venture upwards into the almost irredeemably chossy chimney. Get gear where you can, trust nothing, struggle upward, and eventually pull the roof on the left. Belay up and right on a small ledge at a fixed piton. Experience a profound sense of accomplishment, tempered by regret for your questionable life choices.

**P7, 5.10-, 35m**  
You aren’t done with choss. Climb better rock leading to a large corner. Place cams in kitty litter as you stem upward on exfoliating face holds. Continue up until confronted by a large roof, and move awkwardly right and up onto a ledge to belay.

**P8, 5.10-, 45m**  
Step left along the ledge and climb a delightful, steep hand crack to ledges. Trend considerably rightward on these ledges, eventually stepping right around an arete. Climb a steep ramp back left into the main crack system. Continue upward, trending left beneath a roof before gaining a comically chossy ledge. Belay here. A quality pitch, if you can appreciate the funkiness of the rock at the end.

**P9, 5.11-, 30m**  
Trend up and right to find easier ground, then move back left into the main left-facing corner. Climb up deceptively steep rock through a pronounced crux (adding a bolt to this sequence would probably be a good idea). Continue up a steep left-facing dihedral. Reach a two-bolt belay at a semi-hanging stance. Excellent climbing if you can keep your head together.

**P10, 5.8 A0 (5.10+/5.11-?), 35m**  
Continue up the left-facing corner with difficulty past a bulge (aided by FA, likely quite enjoyable to free climb). When the angle eases, traverse left into the right-facing corner and continue up to a single bolt and cam belay.

**P11, 5.10 A0 (5.10+/5.11-?), 40m**  
From this belay, surprisingly easy ground leads up and left below the roofs. Then, climb a steep wall and make an exposed traverse back right to regain the crack system. Difficult climbing leads through a roof and onto a ledge (aided by FA). Continue up more easily to reach the summit plateau and belay off boulders. In daylight, the position of this exit sequence would be hard to beat.

**Descent** 
Scramble down to the southeast to reach the extreme southern tip of Protection Valley. Between the many waterfalls, one buttress permits moderate scrambling further down than the others. Scramble as far as is reasonable to reach a two-bolt rappel station (51.33399, -115.96911). A rope stretching 60m rappel led to a snow cone in the middle of July. Continue 500m north to reach another series of waterfalls, which can be bypassed on the right, or by descending a very cool cleft in the middle of them (51.33798, -115.96966). Continue down the valley to rejoin the approach trail.

**Rack** 
Doubles from black totem (.2)  to  BD #2, single 3&4. A full set of nuts. A selection of pins is not mandatory but is useful. 60m half ropes.
