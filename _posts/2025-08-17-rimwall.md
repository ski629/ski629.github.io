Gabs Clark and I went to climb **Murder By Numbers**, but got sidetracked on our way and just had to check out the corners beside the giant red streak. Ten hours and a lot of adventure later, we topped out scrambling right up its outflow. It made for a great traditional line with loads of jamming and crack climbing, an alpine character, and a very unique ambiance, being next to the flowing waterfall colored by iron. 

I’d absolutely recommend it.

The route can be climbed adequately safely as-is, but there are two anchors from previous attempts that need retrofitting, and a single protection bolt that could be added. This is detailed below.

**Iron Tears**  
**The Rimwall**  
**5.11- 465m TD-**

When it rains, the Rimwall cries tears of iron. The blood colored streak is visible from the highway eight kilometres away, running down its face and into the valley below. Up close, the tears leave behind a gorgeous patina of oranges and reds, smooth water-worn slabs, and deep runnels in the rock. While they’re flowing, there are waterfalls, creeks, and small pools covering the wall. The Rimwall’s iron tears provide a unique ambiance to an alpine climb.

The actual rock is something special, too. It is predominantly dihedral and chimney crack climbing, featuring loads of hand/fist jams and finger locks, and a good share of lie-backing and proper chimney movement. The rock is generally solid, and the climbing is sustained in the 5.8 to 5.10 range.

Protection is adequate and traditional, if a bit spicy at times. Two aging bolted anchors could use replacement, and a single lead protection bolt is likely justified. This is detailed in the pitch breakdown.

The route would be easiest when fully dry, but a moderate amount of water flow adds an incredible vibe.

In mid-August, the route received sun until the early afternoon. Being sheltered from the prevailing winds and exposed to quite a bit of sun, it is warmer than you would expect from a NE aspect climb.

The pitch descriptions for the latter half of the route are not perfect. Follow the path of least resistance, trust your instincts, and err on the side of splitting pitches up early.

**Approach**  
Park as for West Wind Pass. Approach to the West Wind Col, then contour around the base of the Rimwall. Stop when you reach the pronounced red streak. **1-1.5 hours.**

**P1, 5.0, 60m+**  
The FA party scrambled, starting from the right side of the tears. Climb to a sloping ledge, cross the tears, and gain a right-facing corner. Trend up and left to gain a large scree ledge. Rock shoes and a rope would be advisable.
Alternatively, it seems possible to scramble in from broken ground further the left. This may be less difficult and/or better protected. In either case, you’re targeting a large scree ledge.  
**P2, 5.8, 50m**  
Just to the left of the tears, there is a right-facing corner system. Climb this for 20m to gain a smaller scree ledge. Above, a left-facing corner system continues. Climb this to the top of a pinnacle and a two self-drive belay. As of the FA, one was missing a hanger (but had its nut, which can be unscrewed with a wrench). These should be retrofitted.
Alternatively, break this pitch up halfway and combine the second half of it with P3 to avoid belaying on the self-drives.  
**P3, 5.4, 25m**  
Traverse rightward across the tears. On the far side, trend up and right, targeting the base of a gorgeous dihedral. A good belay stance can be found by trending further right instead of taking the first corner upward.  
**P4, 5.10+, 55m**  
The money pitch. Climb a beautiful left-facing dihedral on hand jams and finger locks to its top, stepping slightly left below a roof to belay off of two #2s beside a lovely pool. Consider splitting the pitch to keep these two cams available. There is a very rusty fixed belay here, which could be retrofitted with modern bolts.  
**P5, 5.11-, 30m**  
The crux pitch. Steep moves off the ground above a manky fixed anchor lead to technical sequences. The crux moves can be protected by a tiny nut, which can be backed up with a large KB or small LA. It might be prudent to add a protection bolt here. Above, the difficulties ease somewhat and become engaging pillar climbing.
Alternatively, if the tears aren’t flowing, you may be able to climb a chimney above the pool, regaining the original line above the crux moves. For the FA this option was a waterfall.  
**P6, 5.9, 30m**  
Continue up a chimney for 30m before stepping right to a belay. It may be possible to link this with the previous pitch.  
**P7, 5.10-, 60m**  
Climb the obvious chimney feature, potentially making it to a large ledge after a full rope length. It may be best to break this up halfway.  
**P8, 5.9, 40m**  
Continue up more chimney features until you reach a wonderful belay ledge. A 10m section of this pitch had running water for the FA, but was still climbable.  
**P9, 5.10-, 25m**  
Climb the lovely corner above to a crux at its top, gaining a large ledge. Head right across this ledge to the base of another left-facing corner. Belay here.  
**P10, 5.10-, 50m**  
Climb the left-facing corner. It’s harder and more technical than it looks. When you reach a ledge, trend left up a right-facing corner to gain a ramp system back towards the tears. Belay a ways up the ramp, but before it turns into unprotectable scree.  
**P11, 5.0, 40m**  
Continue up the ramp back toward the source of the tears. Ascend ledges on the right side of the tears, before eventually stepping back into the tears themselves to gain the scree bowl. Do a Yamnuska-style seated scree belay, or continue up to a rock outcropping. There is little to no good protection on this “pitch”, but the movement is moderate and secure enough, if a bit chossy.

**Descent**  
Tag the summit if you wish, and descend via the scrambling route.

**Rack**  
Single rack .2-3, doubles .3-2. A full set of nuts. A #4 would be useful, as would triple .5 & .75.  
A large KB or small LA could help protect the crux, but otherwise, hammers can be left at home.  
60m ropes, a single/tag configuration is useful for hauling packs on hard / chimney pitches.  
There is loads of sharp jamming, consider crack gloves.
