    caption: "Sometimes bolting is more awkward and strenuous than climbing!"
---
Superbok is one of the most classic ice climbs in the range. Not far away, a massive rock roof forms huge hanging daggers every year. You would think someone who have climbed it by now, given how accessible it is, and that it's visible from the highway.

Nope! Raph Slawinski invited me to take a crack at it, and I was keen. Another route, "Cragganmore", served as approach ice.

We arrived at the base of the wall, to find an existing two bolt anchor. It wasn't recent, and we contemplated whether the line had already been climbed. We couldn't imagine someone having established it without anyone knowing.

Raph moves through unclimbed terrain as quickly as most people move through established routes. He climbed the first pitch primarily on clean gear, pausing to tag the drill up when the protection got unreasonably sparse. A short time later he had a belay established below the roof, and he told me that my job was to clean all the loose rock. And there was plenty of it. I went at it with a hammer, and soon we were sharing the belay.

Establishing the next pitch might have been more strenuous than climbing the previous one. Raph would clip into a bolt, reach as far as humanely possible, and place the next bolt. The nature of the climbing being what it was, this spacing ended up quite appropriate. Some time later he reached the ice, and it was time to reverse the sequence. Aiding backward across a roof is almost as hard as aiding it forward. We didn't have time to take a crack at actually climbing the second pitch that day. 

We returned, and I had the honor of leading the first pitch cleanly. It went smoothly, and soon we were again staring out horizontally across the roof. 

Raph has climbed through many eras of mixed, including heel spurs and figure fours. But neither of those tactics have been a part of his arsenal recently. He had earned the first go at the crux pitch, and he worked it in DTS (no figures) style. It made for a very technical sequence, with minimal feet available. He would climb and whip, working the beta. At one point, a tool stayed behind on the wall when we fell, and when his tether came tight, it snapped, and sling shotted the tool. It plopped into the snow 30 meters below. I sent him one of mine tools, and eventually he danced through the sequence without figures.

I have not climbed through many eras of mixed, but figure fours are definitely part of my toolbox. I like to climb DTS, but to me, this sequence called for upside down wiggling. I climbed the initial ice before reaching for the first placement out in the roof. Rather than launch straight into figures, I found a slot between two icicles and wedged the ankle of my boot between them, pushing against them with my other foot. Essentially the ice climbing version of bicycling with a heel hook.

Now it was time for figures. It only took a couple of them before it was time to transition to the ice. How do you grade that? Despite the exercition being fairly brief, I was jittery as I established myself on the curtain. 

Rasputin Roof
Grade: M9 WI5, 50m
Location: Mount Stephen, Yoho National Park BC
Base Elevation & Aspect: 1650m, Northwest facing
First Ascent: Raphael Slawinski, Greg Barrett, January 2024

ATES: 3
Route Symbols: 4/9, PM sun
Climbing Symbols: Requires ice

Approach
Approach as for Superbok/Cragganmore. Park in the pullout east of Field (xx.xxxxºN, -xxx.xxxxºE).

Cross the river, the tracks and climb up the open snow gully to Cragganmore on the left just before P1 of Superbok. Climb this for three pitches of rambly ice or thin mixed terrain to a bolted belay on the ledge below the huge roof (xx.xxxxºN, -xxx.xxxxºE). xx-xx hours.

Pitch By Pitch
Pitch 1: M4+ 25m
Left of the belay, climb a short crack then and head left on loose rock towards a discontinuous, right-facing, right-leaning corner system. Climb past two fixed pitons and a vein of ice, trending right. At the base of a steeper wall, go rightward past a bolt and move tenuously around a corner. Clip another bolt and go up flakes to a two bolt anchor below the deepest part of the roof.
Pitch 2: M9- WI5 25m
This pitch is entirely bolt/screw protected. Traverse left across a hanging slab on thin tools and better feet, and squeeze behind an ice curtain. Commit to a pumpy sequence across a horizontal roof before gaining the final ice curtain. Stem up and wrap around, heading straight up to a 3 bolt anchor or continuing out the final step of ice.

Descent
Rappel once to the base. Reverse the approach ice, rappelling as needed.

Gear
Cams #.2-3, mid sizes nuts, mid sized rack of screws. Double ropes, 70m useful.
