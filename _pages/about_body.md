A winding road has landed me in Canmore, Alberta, in the Canadian Rockies. My greatest passion over the past decade has been winter climbing, and I'm fortunate to live in a winter climbing paradise.

In recent years, my focus has been on hard mixed climbing and dry tooling, with some forays into alpine climbing. I am pursuing my ACMG Alpine Guide certification to be able to share this love with more people.  

This season, I am on the Canadian National Ice Climbing Team, and will be competing in the 2025 Ice Climbing World Cup in Edmonton.
