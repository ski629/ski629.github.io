> TABVAR was founded in 1994, for the purpose of raising and distributing funds to help with the material costs incurred in the installation of fixed hardware on and maintenance of climbs in the Bow Valley and adjacent areas.

I recently had the opportunity to join TABVAR's board of directors. Retrofitting and route maintenance have been a passion of mine for many years, and this felt like a natural next step.

In essence, my role is the **Director of Retrofitting**. My goal as part of TABVAR is three-fold:
1. To inspire more people to participate in retrofitting efforts
2. To build out the retrofitting skills of our community
3. To steer best practices regarding retrofitting

If you're interested in learning more about retrofitting or helping out, contact TABVAR or me directly. I'm always happy to geek out about hardware and tools. And we can always use more helping hands!
